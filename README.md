About DailyDrishti
DailyDrishti is for people who are looking to become better organized in accomplishing their health and wellness goals. It is hard to remember to do all of the little things right everyday, let alone to remember what the “little things” are. The app prompts the user with various daily tasks that through various research and readings have been deemed positive action. That when done with consistency lead to a happier and healthier life. This app was built with React and styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS.

Getting Started:
1. Visit the DailyDrishti GitHub page and clone the branch to your local machine.
2. In a GitBash terminal, navigate to the root folder of the project.
3. Run the command npm install. This installs node modules for React Bootstrap and React Router DOM.
4. Run npm start to open the app in a browser window.
5. We must now start our JSON server before we can fully explore the app. Open a second GitBash terminal and navigate to the API folder within the root project folder.
6. Run npm i json-server to install JSON Server.
7. Run the command npx json-server -p 8088 -w drishti.json to start the JSON server. The app should now be fully functional within the browser window.
